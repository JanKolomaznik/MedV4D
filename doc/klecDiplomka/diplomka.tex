\section*{submission}
Study available literature and technical documentation about programming on IBM Cell BE architecture. As well as interfaces, development environments and tools for creating programs for CellBE and its particular implementation Play Station 3, IMB system simulator, Cell Blade. Find out its potential and abilities for parallel processing. Learn about design patterns.

Try some algorithm (registration, segmentation) aimed to medical data processing (CT, MR, X-ray images) where huge data sizes are processed and where results has to be get relativelly fast because diagnosis are made for lasg number of patients. It suitable to do comparation study between common PC architecture and CellBE aimed to speed, precision, code complexity and ways of algorithms design itselfs.

\section{Tools installation}
As first you have to do is to download actual SDK. Go to http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/downloads.html?S_TACT=105AGX16&S_CMP=LP. You should download following files:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item SDK 3.1 Installer (cell-install-3.1.0-0.0.noarch.rpm  (11MB))
contains install script and other stuff for SDK installation.
\item SDK 3.1 Developer package ISO image for Fedora 9 (CellSDK-Devel-Fedora_3.1.0.0.0.iso  (434MB))
contains rpm packages that actual SDK is composed from (SDK packages) 
\item SDK 3.1 Extras package ISO image for Fedora 9 (CellSDK-Extras-Fedora_3.1.0.0.0.iso  (34MB))
contains some extra packages for Fedora
\end{enumerate}

Download it wherever you want (even though in documentation is /tmp/cellsdkiso). Lets call the folder, you download it into, ISO_DIR.  First you shall stop the YUM updater daemon.

/etc/init.d/yum-updatesd stop

If this outputs: bash: /etc/init.d/yum-updatesd: No such file or directory, you do not have any YUM updater daemon installed so you can skip this step. Now issue following command to install required utilities for SDK installation

yum install rsync sed tcl wget

Now install the dowloaded installation rpm.

rpm -ivh ISO_DIR/cell-install-3.1.0-0.0.noarch.rpm

After this step you have new stuff in /opt/cell installed. There is SDK installation script (cellsdk) located as well. It is wrapper for YUM that manages the SDK packages. Run it with parameter --help to see the usage. So next step is to run it. 

/opt/cell/cellsdk --iso ISO_DIR -a install

Param --iso tells to use downloaded ISOs and where can be found for mounting them onto loopback device. Param -a disables agreeing licences. Otherwise you have to write some 'yes' to agree. Process begins with setting local YUM repositories pointing to the ISOs. Then all default packages are installed with all their dependecies. To check result of the installation issue

/opt/cell/cellsdk verify

Now we have SDK installed. Lets continue with installation of IDE. It consists again of packages. Now to simplify processing packages install yumex that provides graphical interface to YUM. And lets you simply check packages that you want.

yum install yumex

To install IDE run yumex, goto Group View->Development->Cell Development Tools. Check cellide, that is actual IDE (Eclipse with cell concerning stuff) and ibm-java2-i386-jre, that is Java Runtime Environment, JRE needed for running of IDE. And click 'Process Queue'. Note: you should have the ISOs mounted onto loopback devices. Otherwise you get 'Error Downloading Packages' after clicking 'Process Queue'. Issue this whenever you want to install package concerning Cell SDK

/opt/cell/cellsdk --iso ISO_DIR mount

After the installation you have two new folders. /opt/cell/ide that contains the IDE and /opt/ibm/java2-i386-50 where JRE resides. To run the ide you have to specify folder where the JRE is (through -vm param).

/opt/cell/ide/eclipse/eclipse -vm /opt/ibm/java2-i386-50/jre/bin/

The last part of develelopment environment is IBM Full-System Simulator (systemsym). It is not part of ISOs with SDK so you have to download it separately. Visit http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/cellsystemsim/download and download rpm with the simulator appropriate to the platform you are currently using. Be sure to download fedora 9 version of the simulator (cell-3.1-8.f9.*). Then instal it.

rpm -ivh ISO_DIR/sys

Maybe some dependencies will be missing. So you have to install it. In my case ot was libBLT24 and libtk8.5.

yum install blt tk

Now you have symilator installed. But it has nothing to simulate. Image with image of simulated Fedora 9 system is needed (sysroot image). It is among SDK rpms so install it using yumex (Cell Development Tools -> sysroot_image).
Now all neccessary stuff is installed. You could start the IDE and start development. But there are some bugs to fix yet. 

If you start IDE and it crashes with unhandled exception it is probably caused by xulrunner library. It is ussually installed with Firefox3. There is following workaround:
uninstall the xulrunner
start IDE
create workspace
close 'welcome page' when IDE starts. Important!
close the IDE (save of the workspace will follow)
reinstall the Firefox3 or whatever application uses xulrunner
Now you should start the IDE without the crash. From the workeround can be seen that the welcome page probably cause the troubles so when you create a new workspace you should probably repeat the process.

Another issue (stack issue) is with tcl (scripting language that is used for configuration of the systemsym). There is bug with stack size chechking that causes cycling of tcl code. To workeraound this problem you should use ulimit command that changes default environment of linux programs

ulimit -s unlimited

causes that stack is unlimited.

The last is to fix actual tcl script that manages loading the sysroot_image (21\% issue - loading of the sysroot_image freezes on 21\% so is not started and thats why unusable). It is cause by wrong triggers that are triggerd when some text is output from console by the sysroot_image loading. There is probably triggers that wait for text from previous version of SDK that is never output in the current version. That is why the loading freezes on 21\%. To fix it you have to edit /opt/cell/ide/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.celldt.simulator.profile.default_3.1.0.200809010950/simulator_init.tcl file. Replace the "Welcome to Fedora Core" string with "Welcome to Fedora" and "INIT: Entering runlevel: 2" with "Starting login process".

It is usefull to create starting script. That solve the stack issue and add systemsim directory to PATH (needed for running).

ulimit -s unlimited
PATH=/opt/ibm/systemsim-cell/bin:$PATH
/opt/cell/ide/eclipse/eclipse -vm /opt/ibm/java2-i386-50/jre/bin

kopirovani knihoven do sysrootu:
mount -o loop /opt/ibm/systemsim-cell/images/cell/sysroot_disk /mnt/cell-sdk-sysroot
cp -r /opt/cell/sysroot/usr/lib /mnt/cell-sdk-sysroot/usr/local/lib
