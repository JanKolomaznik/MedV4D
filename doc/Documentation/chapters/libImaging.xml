<title>Architecture</title>

	
	<para>
	Main goal of this library is effective implementation of pipeline computation on input datasets. 
	Whole computation should be as parallel as possible in order to utilize resources available in modern processors, etc. 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Design of interfaces and class hierarchies is aimed to extensibility and code reusability.
	</para>

	<para>
	Pipeline should be built from objects of certain types, which we will now discuss.

	<title>Datasets</title>
	
		<para>
		Actual data are stored in proper descendants of class <classname>AbstractDataSet</classname>. Its hierarchy is shown in <!--TODO -->. Purpose of these 
		classes is to provide access methods for reading and writing informations of certain type and optional synchronization. 
		</para>

		<para>
		By optional synchronization is meant set of synchronization methods, which are not called by access methods in class. And user should
		use these methods only in situations requiring synchronization. This less comfortable though, but more effective.
