	<para>
	Main goal of this library is effective implementation of pipeline computation on input datasets. 
	Whole computation should be as parallel as possible in order to utilize resources available in modern processors, etc. 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Design of interfaces and class hierarchies is aimed to extensibility and code reusability.

	<title>Datasets</title>
	
		<para>
		Actual data are stored in proper descendants of class <classname>AbstractDataSet</classname>. Its hierarchy is shown in <!--TODO -->. Purpose of these 
		classes is to provide access methods for reading and writing informations of certain type and optional synchronization. 
		</para>

		<para>
		By optional synchronization is meant set of synchronization methods, which are not called by access methods in class. And user should
		use these methods only in situations requiring synchronization. This less comfortable though, but more effective.
		</para>

		<formalpara><title><classname>AbstractDataSet</classname></title> 
		<para>Is predecessor of all datastructures containing data. Only concept implemented by this class is read/write locking system. 
		This locking system ensure synchronization only on dataset structure (its extents, allocated buffers, etc.), not on data contained 
		inside. Read/write lock let multiple readers to obtain access and writers have to wait. If there is at least one writer waiting, no 
		other reader is allowed to obtain lock. And when all readers finish their work, first writer get exclusive access. Synchronization 
		on data should be implemented in successors, because it differ in each type of dataset. Changes in internal structure can be detected 
		by comparing timestamps. When some change in internal structure of dataset happens timestamp is increased - so if you store value from 
		previous access you can easily detect changes.

		<para>
		First thing we should know, is how to create filtering pipeline with supposed behaviour using prepared filters. 
		This section will be brief tutorial to pipeline construction. We show possible usage on example class that will have all desired
		abilities normaly distributed across application.
		</para>

		<para>
		Before we start construction, we must decide if we want handle storing and deallocation of all objects. There is 
		prepared container for all pipeline objects, which can handle deallocation of stored objects and semiautomatically connects filters, and 
		other objects with ports used as communication channel. For our example we use this <classname>PipelineContainer</classname>.
		For manual control and construction see its source code.

	<section>
	<title>Creating new filter</title>
		
		<para>
		One of the main advantage of this library is its extensibility. The biggest potential is easy way to add new filters 
		with all features promised by pipeline design (synchronization, parallel execution, etc.). This is achieved through 
		set of filter abstract classes, each designed for special purpose. Author of new filter have to consider few aspects 
		(dimensionality, type of input/output data, way the filter computes, etc.) and choose right ancestor class for his filter.
		</para>

		<para>
		To make decision easier you can use prepared flowchart <xref linkend="pic.MostSuitableFilterFlowchart"/> and find most suitable ancestor class.
		</para>
		
		<figure float="1" id="pic.MostSuitableFilterFlowchart">
		<title>Filter decisive flowchart</title>

			<imageobject><imagedata fileref="figures/libImaging/MostSuitableFilterFlowchart.png" format="PNG" scale="75"/></imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
		</figure>

		<para>
		Now if you have chosen right ancestor class, you can start with actual implementation of your filter. You should keep few rules and concepts, which 
		can not only help you with writing, but even some other parts of library will just work without handling extra issues. This is achieved by generic 
		design of whole library, templates are used almost everywhere.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		We now introduce these rules and concepts, and show practical examples from library sources. First of all try design your filters as generic as possible.
		So try maximally use dataset traits (now only available <classname>ImageTraits</classname>), template specialializations, etc.
		All ancestor classes are templated (with exception of <classname>AbstractPipeFilter</classname>), so it makes that easier.
		</para>

		<para>
		Try to keep these rules, when designing filter interface:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			Filter class has public typedef to predecessor class with name <classname>PredecessorType</classname>.
			</para></listitem>
			
			<listitem><para>
			All properties of filter are in one public nested <classname>struct Properties</classname> deriving from <classname>PredecessorType::Properties</classname>.
			In case, that set of properties is empty, make at least public typedef to <classname>PredecessorType::Properties</classname> with name Properties.	
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			Prepare default constructor, and constructor with pointer to <classname>Properties</classname>. Default constructor creates default set of properties.
			In both constructors pointer to instance of <classname>Properties</classname> is passed to predecessor constructor in list of initializers.
			Using constructor with parameter will completely initialize filter with passed properties, no other method is needed to call.
			</para></listitem>
			
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
		If you follow mentioned rules you can use few preprocessor macros, which can simplify implementation of your class.
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			Pointer to <classname>Properties</classname> structure is stored as protected member <structfield>_properties</structfield>, but its type is 
			<classname>AbstractFilter::Properties</classname>. So if you want access members of your properties structure you must either 
			cast to right type every time, or put preprocessor macro <function>GET_PROPERTIES_DEFINITION_MACRO</function> to private section of your
			class declaration. Now method <function>GetProperties()</function> returning reference to <classname>Properties</classname> is available for
			usage.
			</para></listitem>
			
			<listitem><para>
			To make declaration of Get/Set methods easier three macros are prepared: <function>GET_PROPERTY_METHOD_MACRO( TYPE, NAME, MEMBER_NAME )</function>, 
			<function>SET_PROPERTY_METHOD_MACRO( TYPE, NAME, MEMBER_NAME )</function> and <function>GET_SET_PROPERTY_METHOD_MACRO( TYPE, NAME, MEMBER_NAME )</function>.
			These macros will be unwinded into inline declarations of <function>TYPE Get'NAME'()const</function>, <function>void Set'NAME'( TYPE value )</function> and both.
			Parameter <parameter>NAME</parameter> is used in name of Get/Set method and parameter <parameter>MEMBER_NAME</parameter> is name of <classname>Properties</classname> member 
			accessed by these two methods.
			</para></listitem>
