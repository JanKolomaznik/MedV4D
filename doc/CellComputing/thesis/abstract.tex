Abstract: Study available literature and technical documentation about programming on IBM Cell BE architecture.
Interfaces, development environments and tools for creating programs for CellBE and its particular implementation Play Station 3, IBM system simulator, Cell Blade.
Find out its potential and abilities for parallel processing. Learn about design patterns.
Try some algorithm (registration, segmentation) aimed to medical data processing (CT, MR, X-ray images) where huge data sizes are processed and where results has to be get relativelly fast because diagnosis are made for lasg number of patients.
It suitable to do comparation study between common PC architecture and CellBE aimed to speed, precision, code complexity and ways of algorithms design itselfs.

Keywords: CellBE programming, multicore acceleration, IBM, PS3
