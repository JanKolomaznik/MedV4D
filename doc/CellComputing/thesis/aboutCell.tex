\chapter{Introduction}

\par
The production of x86 platform processors has started a big frequency competition.
The manufacturers have been releasing processors with higher and higher operating frequency.
Behind this competition there has been a significant amount of research of new production technologies that allow to integrate more transistors onto a smaller area.
Gradually the manufacturers started to realize that it is impossible to continue the competition forever.

\par
More computing units started to be integrated into a single processor.
The first among common desktop processors was Intel's Pentium\textsuperscript{\textregistered} with hyper-threading.
This processor was able to execute two threads at a time.
Since then a quick boom of multi-core integration started even among other big processor manufacturers.

\par
Integration of more execution cores allows less power consumption.
This factor is nowadays especially important due to processor integration into laptops and even due to environmental issues.
Therefore current effort of the processor manufacturers is to gain the best performance to power consumption ratio.

\par
General purpose cores are integrated into the current common processors.
It means they have a pipeline for instruction execution composed of several stages.
Instruction can be in various states in the pipeline, e.g. fetched, awaiting operands, ready, executed.
Instructions do not flow among the stages in the order that designates the program but the order is decided by the processor itself.
The decision is based on variety of factors and predictions.
One of the pipeline stages is a branch-prediction unit.
It has to predict the most probable flow of the executed program.
When this prediction is false the whole pipeline has to be discarded and execution of the right branch of the program has to be started.
Processors suffer heavily from these mispredictions because they lead into big execution holes in which the processor pipeline stalls or is being reset.\\

\par
Cache misses are another general purpose processor suffering.
A cache miss occurs when the requested data are not within processor cache and have to be loaded from the main memory.

\par
Although many improvements were implemented into the general purpose processors they still suffer from the described problems.
This is one of the reasons why a collaboration of three big companies IBM, Sony, and Toshiba started development of the \mbox{Cell/B.E.} processor.
It is a multi-core processor which has high performance to power consumption ratio and is able to overcome the problems that the general purpose processors suffer from.
That is because it allows the programmer to manage processor cache and branch prediction unit to a certain degree.
The next chapter will describe the processor in more details.

\chapter{\mbox{Cell/B.E.} platform}

This chapter will introduce the Cell Broadband Engine processor (\mbox{Cell/B.E.}), the whole platform and its specific details.
The particular \mbox{Cell/B.E.} processor will be described and illustrated.
All the information were taken from \cite{cbeCenter}.

\par
\mbox{Cell/B.E.} processor is representative of a new generation of IBM's \mbox{Cell/B.E.} platform family.
\mbox{Cell/B.E.} is an asymmetric, high-performance multi-core processor that combines eight synergistic processing elements (SPE) and a Power Processing Element (PPE), which is a general-purpose IBM Power PC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} core.
The next important part is a central memory element.
The PPE can operate with the central memory directly while the SPE can access the memory indirectly through DMA.
All the elements are connected through a high speed bus (EIB - Element Interconnect Bus).
The whole layout is in the figure \ref{fg:processorLayout}.

    \label{fg:processorLayout}
\end{figure}

The \mbox{Cell/B.E.} achieves a significantly better performance per Watt and performance per chip area ratios than conventional high-performance processors.
It is more flexible and programmable than single-function and other optimized processors such as graphics processors, or conventional digital signal processors.
While a conventional microprocessor may deliver about 20+GFlops of single-precision (32b) floating-point performance, Cell delivers 200+ GFlops (under ideal conditions) at a comparable power consumption.

A number of signal processing and media applications have been implemented on the \mbox{Cell/B.E.} with excellent results.
Advanced visualization techniques such as ray-casting, ray-tracing and volume rendering, streaming applications such as media encoders, decoders or encryption and decryption algorithms have also been demonstrated to perform about an order of magnitude better than a conventional processors.


\section{PPE - Power Processing Element}

The PPE is derived from IBM Power PC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} core. It has 512kB L2 on die cache.
It supports the Power Architecture ISA, inherits the memory translation, protection, and SMP coherence model of mainstream 64-bit Power processors.
Virtualization, logical partitioning, large pages, and other recent innovations in the Power architecture are supported as well.
Programming for the PPE is the same as for conventional processors due to direct access to central memory.

\section{SPE - Synergistic Processing Element}

\par
SPE is an autonomous processor (sometimes called accelerator) targeted for computational intensive applications.
Each SPE has a SIMD core (SPU), a high-speed private local store memory and a direct memory access (DMA) engine.

\par
The SPU unit has 128 128-bit wide unified general purpose registers to store all types of data in contrast to traditional RISC processors where registers are divided according data types.
It supports a SIMD-RISC instruction set.
The SPU has two pipelines, the odd one and the even one, so it can execute two instructions at a time (dual-issue) if some conditions are met.
Vectorized operations in various data types configurations can be performed with these registers e.g. two double-precision floats or eight 32bit integers can be processed at single clock tick.

\par
Unlike conventional microprocessors the SPE does not have a hardware cache.
Its function represents the small on-chip local store memory under programmer's control.
This allows code optimizations that can reduce cache misses.
The local store is separated from the main memory i.e. the SPE has its own address space.
Therefore any synchronization with other cores is not necessary.
The SPE uses the local store as a cache of data stored in the central memory i.e. programmer has to create copies of the data within the local store.
The data are transferred through DMA engine which manages transferring data from central memory to local store and vice versa as well as between two SPEs' local stores.
We say that data is "DMAed" from source to destination.
DMA commands can be issued in many ways such as in synchronous, asynchronous or in scatter-gather manner through DMA lists.
The DMA list is an array of pointer-size pairs that defines pieces of memory that shall be transferred within single DMA request.
The pieces must not necessarily be continuous.
Therefore the \mbox{Cell/B.E.} processor can be viewed as a distributed memory multiprocessor.
The local store memory management is a big part of programming for the \mbox{Cell/B.E.}

\par
Programming for the SPE is a bit different compared to programming for a conventional processor.
Programmer have always to count with the fact that he/she has only 256kB for the program and data.
More details about this topic will be described in the next chapter.

\par
The \mbox{Cell/B.E.} is embedded in game console Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) as well as IBM Blade servers where are two processors on one board, building block.
There can be more boards connected in one system forming a powerful and modular machine.
We have two PS3 machines available for this work.
