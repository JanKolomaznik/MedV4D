This shows how to connect Qt and VTK and how to process window events.
It uses mouse movement (via vtkInteractorStyleImage.h) to set parameters
to several VTK filters and displays the filtered image afterwards.

The filters are:

- a 3x3 convolution kernel
- an ideal low-pass (implemented using FFT->IdealLowpass->RFFT)
- clipping

It doesn't use the assumed M4D directory structure, but should
show the general idea.
