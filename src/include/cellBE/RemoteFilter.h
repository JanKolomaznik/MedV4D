/**
 *  Base class for every remote filter. 
 *  Remote filter contains definition
 *  of remote pipeline, that the filter represents. Actual definition has
 *  to be made through members of FilterProperties descendant type (for
 *  example ThresholdingFilter<>::Properties typed member represents
 *  thresholding filter). Current implementation lets only linear remote
 *  pipelines to be crated. Actual creation of pipeline is of course performed
 *  on the server but based on vector of FilterProperties that it recieves.
 *  So definig pipeline is through vector (defining vector) where order of filterProperties
 *  in vector corresponding with order of appropriate filter in remote
 *  pipeline. 
 *  FilterProperties are serialized through FilterPropertiesSerializers.
 *  So actual definig vector is vector of FilterPropertiesSerializers. This vector
 *  should be created in appropriate remote filter constructor and then passed
 *  to CreateJob method of CellClient object. Actual creation of 
 *  FilterPropertiesSerializers is done through templated methodes of 
 *  GeneralFilterSerializer object.
 *  Beside creation of FilterPropertiesSerializers there should be created
 *  apporopriate DataSetSerializers that performs actual dataSet serialization
 *  and deserialization of result dataSet sent from server. Both these object
 *  (input and output dataSetSerializers) has to passed as well to CreateJob method.
